## 11 MICROSERVICE CICD PIPELINE PROJECT ULTIMATE DEVOPS PIPELINE

#### Microservices architecture has gained popularity in software development for several reasons. Here are a few key advantages:

#### Scalability:

Microservices allow individual components of an application to be scaled independently, ensuring efficient use of resources. This is particularly useful for handling varying loads and optimizing performance.

#### Flexibility and Agility:

Development teams can work on different services simultaneously, allowing for faster iterations and more frequent releases. This also supports diverse technology stacks, as each microservice can be built with the most appropriate technology for its specific function.

#### Fault Isolation:

In a microservices architecture, a failure in one service does not necessarily bring down the entire system. This isolation helps in maintaining overall system stability and resilience.

#### Ease of Deployment:

Microservices can be deployed independently, which simplifies the process of rolling out updates and new features. This reduces the risk of large-scale failures and allows for continuous deployment practices.

#### Improved Maintainability:

With services being smaller and focused on specific tasks, codebases are easier to manage and understand. This modularity simplifies maintenance, debugging, and refactoring processes.

#### Enhanced Testing and Monitoring:

Since each microservice is a discrete unit, it is easier to test and monitor individual services. This leads to more effective detection and resolution of issues.

#### Organizational Alignment:

Microservices align well with modern development teams that follow DevOps and Agile methodologies. They support distributed teams working on different components without stepping on each other's toes.

## Project Implementation

- Setup an EC2 Instance : t2.large (8gb ram), 25gb Storage, and remember to add needed ports to your security group

- Set up your Iam Users and attach policies that would give eks enough priviledge

## Install The Cli's
